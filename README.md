# Thymio Robot Shape Finder
 A python application that uses the Thymio robot and a camera to find shapes drawn in papers.
 
## Requirements:
- An app that streams a camera stream via Wi-Fi. We used the DroidCam app available on Play Store.
- A Thymio robot
- Python

To run the project, run _main.py_. It will install the libraries you don't have and execute the app.
 
## Objectives
- Create a navigation system for the Thymio robot so that it may travel on its
own inside a predetermined environment while avoiding obstacles and
adhering to a predetermined course.
- Implement shape identification: Using image processing techniques to
recognize and distinguish between various shapes, the Thymio robot should be
able to identify a particular shape that the user has specified.
- Integrate classroom knowledge: The project's goal was to use the theoretical
ideas and practical strategies we acquired in class, such as programming, using
sensors, and implementing algorithms, to achieve the project's goals.
